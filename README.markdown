My configuration files for vim, tmux and shell.

The .XCompose file allows me to use the "`" as the prefix for tmux on a Spanish keyboard without having to press it twice.

Disclaimer: I'm not the author of any of the plugins included under my .vim/ folder.

TODO:

* Configure vim + tmux integration.
* Get rid of git-gui and gitk using vim + fugitive + command line. Maybe gitv?
* Make tmux look nicer.
* Try adding zsh to the mix.
