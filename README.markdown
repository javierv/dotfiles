My configuration files for vim, tmux and shell.

Installation:

1. Clone the repository
1. Run `ruby install.rb`

Since it's intended for my personal use, the script shows no mercy on existing files, so be sure you know what you're doing.

The .Xmodmap file allows me to use the "`" as the prefix for tmux on a Spanish keyboard without having to press it twice.

TODO:

1. Configure zsh.
1. Make tmux look nicer.
1. Improve pry + rails console + vim integration.
