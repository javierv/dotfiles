My configuration files for vim, tmux and shell.

Installation:

1. Clone the repository
1. Run `ruby install.rb`

Since it's intended for my personal use, the script shows no mercy on existing files, so be sure you know what you're doing.

TODO:

1. Experiment improving keyboard layout.
1. Configure zsh.
1. Make tmux look nicer.
