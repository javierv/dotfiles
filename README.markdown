My configuration files for vim, tmux and shell.

The .Xmodmap file allows me to use the "`" as the prefix for tmux on a Spanish keyboard without having to press it twice.

Disclaimer: I'm not the author of any of the plugins included under my .vim/ folder.

TODO:

1. Configure zsh.
1. Improve git + vim configuration.
1. Improve vim + tmux integration.
1. Make tmux look nicer.
